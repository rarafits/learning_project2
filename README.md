This project is about data cleaning process.
The data cleaning process is an essential stage in data analysis that ensures the integrity, quality, and accuracy of data before further analysis. Here are the typical stages involved in the data cleaning process:

1. **Data Collection:** The initial stage involves gathering data from various sources, such as databases, CSV files, or surveys. This data may come in different formats and varying qualities.

2. **Data Inspection:** The collected data is then examined to determine if there are missing, duplicate, or erroneous data. This process includes identifying missing values, inconsistent data, or incorrect data entries.

3. **Handling Duplicates:** Duplicate data needs to be identified and either removed or merged into a single entity, depending on the context and analysis requirements.

4. **Handling Missing Data:** Missing or empty data must be filled with appropriate values. This can be done using statistical methods like imputation or by discarding data that cannot be recovered.

5. **Data Validation:** Data is checked to ensure that values fall within predefined boundaries. For example, if there's an age column, we can check if there are values outside a reasonable age range.

6. **Data Transformation:** Data often needs to be modified or processed to conform to the required format for further analysis. This may involve data type conversions, normalization, or column merging.

7. **Data Quality Cleaning:** This involves identifying and addressing inaccurate data, such as incorrect punctuation or unrecognized characters.

8. **Experimental Data Validation:** The cleaned data can be validated through experiments or testing to ensure that the cleaned data meets expectations.

After going through all these stages, the cleaned data is ready for further analysis. The data cleaning process is a crucial foundation for making accurate decisions and extracting useful insights in various fields, including data science, business, and other scientific disciplines.

Additionally, I have been working on coding exercises where I have utilized functions like third_place, square_root, and distance. In these exercises, I was presented with various scenarios and successfully solved them based on the instructions provided in the accompanying exercise files.
